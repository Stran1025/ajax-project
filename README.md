# Poke Builder
## A web application for pokemon players to build and plan their team.
I have always been a big fan of Pokemon, whether it was the Anime, the Games or, just playing cards. I was getting into a tournament hosted by my friends so I build this app to keep track and help me visualize all the details surrounding each of my specific team.
## Here is the live deployment of the project: (https://stran1025.github.io/poke-builder/)
## I used Javascript, HTML, CSS, and AJAX to build this project. Big thanks to the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/)

One Features would like to add is giving each pokemon a tag as for their roles for the team. (ie Absol get a sweeper tag)
